/**
 * Instances of this class provide a no-op implementation for custom serialisation. Since the companion app will never (de-)serialise any
 * cache values, it technically does not require any custom serialiser at all. But in order to succeed in Ignite's configuration checks
 * within a distributed grid, the same serialiser classes need to be configured for the same key and value classes. This no-op
 * implementation class provides the basis for all specific serialiser classes that only exist to satisfy the validation.
